# Slim Character Sheet for 5th Edition

My players use a combination of paper and D&D Beyond to run their characters, and the character sheet in Foundry got in the way. But Foundry is magic and if I don't like something, I can just change it.

This sheet includes only the bare essentials required for combat and stuff:

## Installation

1. Paste the following link into Foundry's module installer: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxbucknell/5e-slim-character-sheet/main/module.json`
2. Enable the module in your world
3. The sheet can either be set as the default sheet for characters, or used on a per-actor basis:
